# About The App

My Contact-list is an app that fetches 10 contacts from the api https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/(/users) and displays them in a card format. The package ‘axios’ has been used to fetch the api. Each individual card contains the username, phone number, address, name of the company, and email.
The app has a functionality of searching a particular contact. If a user types a name, if that is present, it is shown and the rest of the contacts are hidden. The app also displays the number of users present.
Initially, as the app is fetching the contacts from the api, the user can see a spinner being loaded, which disappears as soon as the contacts are displayed.
The app is responsive and has two particular breakpoints. React bootstrap has been used for this responsive design.
